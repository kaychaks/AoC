# Advent of Code

Over the years, I have tried solving puzzles using various languages - Haskell and Lean.
In 2022, I am building a Rust-based system to solve the same puzzles.

I have moved yesteryear's attempts to the `archive` folder.

The main folder would consist of the Rust project, which has the `aoc-lib` library (_will write more about it in future_), the `solutions` folder consisting of solutions to the puzzles every year (starting with `year_2022`), and the `main` function which uses the solutions to generate the answers.

_I plan to convert the same `main` function to a CLI app._
